# MusicRoom

# In order to use this project, you must create a file called credentials.py inside the spotify directory.
# In this file, you have to add the following lines:

# CLIENT_ID = "your client id"
# CLIENT_SECRET = "your client secret"
# REDIRECT_URI = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/spotify/redirect"

# Replace 'your client id' and 'your client secret' with the corresponding credentials from your app
# which you can get from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/ after creating an app.
